              Rich here, the founder of Sendlead.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
              This bootcamp was something we originally put together for new clients to help them get the most out of our lead generation services. But we've decided to release it as a standalone offer because the strategies work so well on their own.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
              I spent years working in digital marketing and enterprise sales, helping companies scale their lead generation. The same problems existed everywhere - businesses paying thousands for leads that never converted, sales teams chasing unqualified prospects, marketing budgets wasted on volume instead of quality.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
              In early 2023, I decided to build something different. Instead of another lead generation company promising quantity, I wanted to focus entirely on exclusive, properly qualified leads that actually convert.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
              Through those early experiments, I learned what truly matters in lead generation. Not fancy technology or clever tactics - just rigorous qualification, exclusive delivery, and obsessive focus on conversion rates over vanity metrics.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
              Now we work with a select few partners whose values align with ours - businesses that understand quality leads drive better results than chasing vanity metrics.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
              If you're looking to scale with qualified leads instead of wasting time on unvetted prospects, we'd love to chat.
