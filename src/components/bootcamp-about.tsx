              This bootcamp was something we originally put together for new clients to help them get the most out of our lead generation services. But we've decided to release it as a standalone offer because the strategies work so well on their own.

            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
              I spent years working in digital marketing and enterprise sales, helping companies scale their lead generation. The same problems existed everywhere - businesses paying thousands for leads that never converted, sales teams chasing unqualified prospects, and companies 'doing marketing' with no focus on performance.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
              In this bootcamp you will find the tactics and strategies we used to scale our partners. You can skip the guesswork and expensive mistakes, simply apply these lessons and your brokerage will grow.
