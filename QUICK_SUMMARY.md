2. Find your link: `https://buy.stripe.com/9B628k3ubgwS4WKd8qcbC00`
3. Click **Edit**
4. Set **Success URL** to:

**For Production:**
```
https://sendlead.co.uk/c/7d-lead-gen-xK9mP2nQ8vL5wR4jTc6h
```

**For Local Testing:**
```
http://localhost:3000/c/7d-lead-gen-xK9mP2nQ8vL5wR4jTc6h
```

5. Click **Save**

## 📍 What Changed

### Before:
- User enters email → Gets instant access
- Course was free
- No payment required

### After:
- User clicks button → Stripe checkout → Payment → Course access
- Course is £28
- Payment required via Stripe

---

## 🎯 The Flow

```
/bootcamp 
  ↓ Click "Get Instant Access - £28"
Stripe Checkout Page
  ↓ Pay £28
/c/7d-lead-gen-xK9mP2nQ8vL5wR4jTc6h
  ↓ 
Course loads immediately! ✅
```

**Security:** Only people who pay get redirected to the secret URL. The URL itself is protected by being unguessable and not indexed anywhere.

## ✨ All Set!

Just configure that Stripe success URL and you're live! 🚀
