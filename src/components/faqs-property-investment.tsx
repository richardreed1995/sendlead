  {
    question: "What exactly do I get with your property investment leads?",
    answer: "Qualified, exclusive property investment prospects delivered to your CRM with complete contact details, qualification data, and automated nurture sequences. Everything needed to close more property investment deals consistently."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does setup take?",
    answer: "48-72 hours maximum. We don't mess about with lengthy onboarding processes. You'll be receiving qualified leads within three business days of signing up."
  },
  {
    question: "Are your leads actually exclusive?",
    answer: "Yes. Unlike lead companies that sell the same lead to multiple brokers, every prospect comes to you and only you. We legally guarantee exclusivity in our contract."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you qualify these property investment leads?",
    answer: "15-point qualification system including investment criteria, budget verification, timeline, and application readiness. Time-wasters get filtered out before they reach you."
  },
  {
    question: "What's your replacement policy?",
    answer: "We replace any lead with invalid contact details or obvious data issues. On average, we replace 4-7% of leads. Record any issues in your CRM and we'll verify and replace immediately."
  },
  {
    question: "Will this work for my type of property investment business?",
    answer: "Our system works for buy-to-let investments, commercial property investments, off-plan investments, and general property investment brokers. We adapt the qualification criteria to match your investment focus."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the investment?",
    answer: "Fixed cost per lead. Most partners start with a test order of 25-50 leads to test the quality and scale up their volume from there. No setup fees, no monthly retainers, no long-term contracts."
