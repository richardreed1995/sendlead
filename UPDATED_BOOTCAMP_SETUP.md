## 🔐 Security Features

Your course has these security features:
- ✅ Course is at secret, unguessable URL
- ✅ Not indexed by search engines (robots.txt + noindex tags)
- ✅ URL is only shared via Stripe after payment
- ✅ Stripe payment link controls access

**Note:** The course loads directly (no verification). Security relies on the secret URL that only paying customers receive.

## 💡 Optional: Add More CTAs

Want more conversion opportunities? Add the pricing component:

In `/src/app/bootcamp/page.tsx`, import and add:

```tsx
import BootcampPricing from "@/components/bootcamp-pricing";

// In your JSX:
<BootcampValueStack />
<BootcampPricing />  {/* ← Adds a full pricing card */}
<BootcampAbout />
```

This adds a detailed pricing section with features list!
